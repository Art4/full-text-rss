Full-Text RSS
=============

About
-----

See http://fivefilters.org/content-only/ for a description of the code.


Installation
------------

1. Extract the files in this ZIP archive to a folder on your computer.

2. FTP the files up to your server

3. Access index.php through your browser. E.g. http://my-host.com/full-text-rss/index.php

4. Enter a URL in the form field to test the code

5. If you get an RSS feed with full-text content, all is working well. :)

Configuration (optional)
------------------------

1. Save a copy of config.php as custom_config.php and edit custom_config.php

2. If you decide to enable caching, make sure the cache folder (and its 2 sub folders) is writable.
(you might need to change the permissions of these folders to 777 through your FTP client).
