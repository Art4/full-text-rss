# Libraries

## Updating libraries

Some of the libraries in this folder can be updated with composer:

```sh
cd ./libraries/
composer update
```

Remember to read the change-logs, proof-read the changes, preserve possible local patches, add irrelevant files to [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) (minimal installation), and test before committing.
